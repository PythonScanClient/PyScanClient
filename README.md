# PyScanClient
A collaboratively developed Python/Jython Scan Server Client.

 * Allows python or jython code to assemble, submit and monitor scans via the ScanServer's REST interface.
 * Scans can be submitted in underlying XML format, as list of python Command objects, or via higher-level abstactions like a "Scan Table".
